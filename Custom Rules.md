## Rebellion

Source: http://beemoon.x.fc2.com/HCL42.html

A rule for when you want to roleplay the erotic part first and the battle later. Useful for that "lewd monster of the week" games.

### Session Flow

### Scene 1

The GM explains what kind of scene is happening and the player makes a "Rebellion Check".

1. Player assess the situation and may declare the use of a Crisis Act. (Ignore usage restrictions. Any number is ok.) 
2. Player earns a bonus 1 CP for participation.
3. Player uses as many CP as they like (0 points are ok) then roll a 1D6 for each CP used. Each 5 and 6 counts as success, and you need only 1 success. Crisis Abilities can't be used here.
4. If it succeeds, record it as "Rebellion: 1". If it fails, player earns +2 SP.

Roleplay the scene as usual. Even if the roll succeeds the Player may give in to the situation: "*I'm losing my virginity to an orc!*" or "*why is this tentacle so tasty?*".
\
At the end of the scene, the Player may once again declare Crisis Acts that were used in that scene. (Ignore usage restrictions. Any number is ok.) 

### Scene 2 and 3

Proceed in the same way as Scene 1. 
\
Be sure to do 3 times the "Rebellion Check", one for each Scene.

### Climax Battle

GM explains who was behind all the lewd and/or the Player finally catches up to the monster. Time for the final battle!
\
Here, we check how many times the "Rebellion Check" was successful. 
In the case of multiple PL sessions, it applies separately. 

1. If Rebellion = 3 the Player can act one additional turn before the start of the first turn (separate from surprises, can act faster than surprises) ;
2. If Rebellion = 2, fight as usual;
3. If Rebellion = 1, the Player can not do anything except [passive] on the first turn. 
4. If Rebellion = 0, the Player can not participate in the battle, the session is automatically defeated. 
In a multiple PL session, if there are other characters with "Dist: 1" or more, 
Participate in the battle as Rebellion: 1, and if you are alive at the end of the session, shake only the Complete List and follow the effect. 

↓ 
Combat start! Crisisact can not be used in this battle. 
It is possible to roll erol with “Takin Engraving” and the first half of the rhyme, but it is not long. 
↓ 
Depending on the outcome of the battle, perform a normal end process. 
If you use this rule, you have to increase your experience level to 5 points at the end to increase the difficulty level.
