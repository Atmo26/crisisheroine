## Rebellion

A rule for when you want to roleplay the erotic part first and the battle later.

### Session Flow

### Scene 1

The GM explains what kind of scene is happening and the player makes a "Rebellion Check".

1. Player assess the situation and may declare the use of a Crisis Act. (Ignore usage restrictions. Any number is ok.) 
2. Player earns a bonus 1 CP for participation.
3. Use as many CP as you like. (0 points are OK) 
Succeeding [1D6] by the number of units consumed, it will be successful if even one "5" or "6" comes out. 
You can not increase this die by <potential> or reshape it by <saving grace>. 
4. If it succeeds, record it as "rebellion: 1". 
(Used during climax battle) 
If it fails, +2 [SP] 
  
  Depending on the act used by PL, perform an erol. 
Even if you succeed in the "defensive check", you can give in to the situation as a role. 
(A kind of resistance burns up slightly in my heart, etc.) 
↓ 
At the end of the scene, you may once again declare a crisis act that "was used in that scene". 
(Ignore usage restrictions. Any number is OK) 

### Scene 2, 3

Proceed in the same way as scene 1. 
※ Be sure to do 3 times the "defensive check" (and the timing of using the crisis act) 
<Climax Battle> 

GM explains the battle history / PL rolls against it そ れ 
Here, we check how many times the "defense check" was successful. 
In the case of multiple PL sessions, it applies separately. 
If Rebellion: 3 the character can act one additional turn before the start of the first turn (separate from surprises, can act faster than surprises) 


1. If "rebellion: 2", fight as usual 
2. If Rebellion: 1, that character can not do anything except [passive] on the first turn. 
3. If "Rebellion: 0" that character can not participate in the battle, the session is automatically defeated. 
In a multiple PL session, if there are other characters with "Dist: 1" or more, 
Participate in the battle as Rebellion: 1, and if you are alive at the end of the session, shake only the Complete List and follow the effect. 

↓ 
Combat start! Crisisact can not be used in this battle. 
It is possible to roll erol with “Takin Engraving” and the first half of the rhyme, but it is not long. 
↓ 
Depending on the outcome of the battle, perform a normal end process. 
If you use this rule, you have to increase your experience level to 5 points at the end to increase the difficulty level.
