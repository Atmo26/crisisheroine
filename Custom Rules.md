## Rebellion

Source: http://beemoon.x.fc2.com/HCL42.html

A rule for when you want to roleplay the erotic part first and the battle later. Useful for that "lewd monster of the week" games.

### Scene 1

The GM explains the *Situation* happening.

1. Player assess the situation and may declare the use of a Crisis Act. (Ignore usage restrictions. Any number is ok.) 
2. Player earns a bonus 1 CP for participation.
3. Player uses as many CP as they like (0 points are ok) then roll a 1D6 for each CP used. Each 5 and 6 counts as success, and you need only 1 success. Crisis Abilities can't be used here.
4. If it succeeds, record it as "Rebellion: 1". If it fails, player earns +2 SP.

Roleplay the scene as usual. Even if the roll succeeds the Player may give in to the situation: "*I'm losing my virginity to an orc!*" or "*why is this tentacle so tasty?*".
\
At the end of the scene, the Player may once again declare Crisis Acts that were used in that scene. (Ignore usage restrictions. Any number is ok.) 

### Scene 2 and 3

Proceed in the same way as Scene 1. 
\
Be sure to do 3 times the "Rebellion Check", one for each Scene.

### Climax Battle

GM explains who was behind all the lewd and/or the Player finally catches up to the monster. Time for the final battle!
\
Here, we check how many times the "Rebellion Check" was successful.
\
In the case of multiple Players, it applies separately for each.

- If Rebellion = 3, the Player can act one additional turn before the start of the first turn;
- If Rebellion = 2, fight as usual;
- If Rebellion = 1, the Player can not do anything except Auxiliary actions on the first turn;
- If Rebellion = 0, the Player can not participate in the battle, the magical girl is automatically defeated. 

In a multiple Player session, if there are other characters with Rebellion = 1 or more, one will use their Rebellion value and the others will participate in the battle as Rebellion = 1. Treat this Player as the "protagonist of the episode".

Crisis Acts can't be used during this final battle. 

If you use this rule, award each surviving Player with +5 CP for Advancement.
