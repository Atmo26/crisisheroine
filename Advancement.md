# Advancement
CP gained over the course of the session = Exp.
Exp required for level up: current Lv x 5

On an odd level gain:
* Any stat +1
* HP +3
* Conjuration or Evocation +1 (Choose)
* 1 new Spell
* 1 new Crisis Ability

On an even level gain:
* Any two stats +1 (not one stat +2)
* HP +3
* Conjuration or Evocation +1 (Choose)
* 1 new Spell

If Conjuration changed you can also change your equipment loadout.

If a character's total SP reaches a multiple of 10, they gain a new Imprint at the end of the session. [Whether this is the
player's choice or the GM's is not specified]

Also check available Crisis Acts in case their prerequisites are not fulfilled anymore. If you no longer qualify for a crisis
act, exchange it for no cost.

In addition, players may change 1 of their Crisis Acts at the end of the session.

Characters also gain 1 rank to any emotion, though it should be fitting to the session. The maximum rank for a single
entry is 5.
