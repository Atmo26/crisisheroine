Underneath the remnants of your outfit is the sight of your relentlessly trained pussy indulgently clutching onto some sexual creature or object that it has been filled with. Perhaps it was left there as a good luck charm from your Master.

Whether it was caused by the sight of your Master or perhaps a Heroine reminding you of your former self, the sight before your eyes brings the memory of a previous humiliation to the front of your mind for a moment. For you, it's now a sweet memory of the beginning of your love for your Master.

\
