# Equipment

In this game, what we call "Equipment" is actually a mass of magical material solidified by Conjuration. It is not
something you can buy somewhere, and PCs that are owners of the items can not be transferred to others. Be careful.

Regarding weapons, they are broad groups. A medium weapon could be a spear or a sword or even a scythe.

[Cost]............ How much Conjuration is required to be allocated to have possession of the item.

[Range] .......... Whether a weapon is ranged or not.

[Classification].. Whether the weapon is Shooting or Melee.

[Power]........... Determines the Damage Bonus when using the weapon.

[AP].............. How much [AP] is in each part of armor.

[Special effect] . It is literally a special effect. However, please be aware that the special effect of armor is lost
when AP becomes 0.
