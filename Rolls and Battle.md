## General Rolling Rules

Most rolls are accomplished with (2d6+ a stat of GM's choice.) The result of the roll is checked against a target value decided by the GM. If the Result is higher than the target value, the action succeeded. Sometimes you will need to
make an opposed roll. Two parties who are in direct, active competition against each other both roll. The higher result is the winner of the opposed roll. In case of a tie, the winner is the defending character.
