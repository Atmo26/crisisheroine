## General Rolling Rules

Most rolls are accomplished with (2d6+ a stat of GM's choice.) The result of the roll is checked against a target value decided by the GM. If the Result is higher than the target value, the action succeeded. Sometimes you will need to make an opposed roll. Two parties who are in direct, active competition against each other both roll. The higher result is the winner of the opposed roll. In case of a tie, the winner is the defending character.

## Magic and MP Recovery

All Heroines can use magic. The majority of spells in the game are used in combat, though it is unwise to ignore the use of utility magic outside of combat. Regardless of when it is used, Spells consume MP. The MP cost is listed for the spell. When you use the spell, you lose that much MP. MP is completely restored at the end of a scene. If you are under the influence of a bad status or something similar, be sure to apply it. In ambiguous situations, the GM decides how recovery works.

## Combat

Eventually you will do battle with monsters. First though, you need to decide the formation. That said, just decide if you're in the vanguard or the rearguard.

Whether you are in the vanguard or the rearguard decides what attacks, spells, or traps can affect you. You can use weapons and spells with *Ranged* regardless of what position you are in. Weapons or spells without *Ranged* can only be used on allies in the same position as you, or against enemies in direct opposition of you (usually the other vanguard while you are in the vanguard). An exception is if there is no one in the vanguard. You can target the opposition's rearguard from the vanguard in this situation.

When a pincer attack, an attack from both sides, occurs, the enclosed side instead has two vanguards. If there is no vanguard on one side, both sides of the enemies in the vanguard may attack without Ranged attacks. One round of combat is treated as 1 scene. Thus, at the begining of a combat round, all participants regain all MP. Keep in mind Bad Statuses may affect this.

### Combat Start

Characters in battle declare their formation positions now.

### Round Start

First, this is when MP is restored. Spells with Opening usage are declared here. This is when one side can roll for escape. All members make an opposed roll for agility. If every escaping member wins, that side successfully escapes.

### Turn Order

Turn Order is decided by order of descending IV. (Highest IV is first) In situations of ties, the turn goes to PC Heroines->NPC Heroines->Enemies.

### Character Turn

Characters have a Primary Action and a Auxiliary Action on their turn.

A character may use their Primary Action to:

* *Attack with a weapon*: Make a roll adding the weapon's power and deal that much damage to an enemy. Unlike most RPGs, attacks always hit, the attack roll (2d6+weapon power) is used to calculate damage.
* *Use a Spell*: You can use a spell with Active use.
* *Any other Action Permitted by the GM*: Usually this includes the protection of civilians in battle.
* *Wait*: Instead of taking your turn, your IV drops to 0 for this round.
* *Do nothing*: You can always choose to do nothing for the round.

A character may use their Auxiliary Action to:

* *Move*: The character moves from Vanguard to Rearguard or vice-versa. If there are multiple Vanguards, you move from one Vangaurd to a neighboring vanguard. For example, if you are surrounded on the front, back, left, and right, you can move from the back to the left, but not from back to front.
* *Use a Spell*: You can use a spell with the Auxiliary Use
* *Remove Bad Status*: Several, but not all, Bad Statuses can be removed this way.

### Reaction

This is when you can use Spells with Reaction use. Spells are the only defensive measure in this game. If you do not have a Reaction spell, you cannot reduce or ignore damage. For each attack, every participant in battle can react once. However, if multiple spells reduce damage, only the highest reduction applies. Regardless of application of damage, please read "Damage and Violation." As a reaction, you may take the damage of an ally instead, even if you aren't the target of the attack. You can do this regardless of distance or position of the protected ally, unless the GM rules it unreasonable (the party is separated or other reasons.) Please note that the protected character cannot use a reaction. Monsters have defense, which reduces the amount of damage they take.

Battle continues until one side is wiped out, surrenders, or escapes.

### Damage and Violation

When you take damage, it reduces your durability and endurance. This endurance is represented by two values: HP and AP. HP is your character's endurance. It is slightly different from their life-force though. AP is your Armor Points. It represents the durability of your clothes and armor.

When a Player Character takes damage, it is either dealt to their AP or their HP. The player decides if the damage goes to AP or to HP. However, if there's at least 1 point of AP, it is wise to apply it to AP. If AP hits 0, that part of the armor is destroyed. AP does not go negative and any leftover damage is lost.

There is an exception. If the dice (not result) of a monster's attack meet or beat the Armor's Direct Hit Value, the damage is directly applied to the Heroine's HP. The monster's hands or tentacles slip through the seams or space of the armor and hit the flesh directly. However, the armor still protects the Heroine somewhat; the damage from the attack is halved. If a spell reduces damage, please reduce damage first, then halve it. (Basically, it's easier to attack after stripping to remove the protection of the armor.) In addition, when Heroines or Dark Heroines attack each other, ignore Direct Hit Value.

The fact that PCs are damaged is described as acts that are central to the spirit to the name "Crisis Heroine." When a Heroine takes damage to AP, their clothes and armor are stripped away. When a Heroine takes HP damage, they are fiddled about by tentacles, slime, or other members. In these circumstances, PC can use up to seven crisis acts during one session. As for what this means, the PCs are insulted, their chastity is compromised, or they are being fucked, but their pinned spirit brings out their hidden power. In terms of games, this means that you can earn CP by describing what kind of shaming the PC receives. In addition, GM may dismiss use if they decide that usage of crisis act is unnatural.

If AP hits 0 then the armor or clothes are so damaged that they are completely useless for protection. Of course, there is nothing to protect the chest or waist (though not naked, it is an unprotected barely clothed state. Remember this.) Also, if a Heroine drops to 0 or less HP, they can no longer fight and risk becoming lost. In other words, she might be corrupted after a thorough violation.

Incidentally, after combat, the standard clothes of the PCs will still be damaged. If they undo their transformation in this state, the clothes that the PCs were wearing before the transformation will also suffer similar damage. This is because weapons are easy for conjuration to shape. Armor though needs a basis to form to cling to the Heroine's body, thus they use them as a base. Ideally PCs should bring a change of clothes, though that would be an interesting place for a surprise attack to take place...

### Activating and Deactivating Traps

Traps support monsters in battle. Traps in this game are not usually hidden; they are almost always public information. In game mechanics, traps cannot be attacked by PCs, but traps are like monsters that consume their own DP.

Traps are broadly grouped as either One Shot or Sustained.

As the name suggests, One Shot are activated once and cannot be used again. In order to prevent their effect, use the skill "Break Trap" to reduce their DP to 0.

On the other hand, Sustained keep giving bad effects to the PCs every round. However, it consumes 2d6 DP every round. Because of this, the effect is guaranteed to end eventually. If you want to end the effect sooner, use "Break Trap" against it. The trap stops working once it hits 0 DP.

### AP Recovery

Earlier it was mentioned that damage to armor in combat applies to clothes in the untransformed state. In order to recover AP you must  change clothes and wait a few hours after the last transformation.

The first task can be accomplished easily. A new medium is needed. As for the latter, please interpret this as "time to fill the power of Conjuration to transform again". It's not good for game balance to transform so quickly with restoration. However, in certain circumstances presented by the GM, there is no limit.

### Bad Status

During battle, tentacles might bind a heroine's actions, or an aphrodisiac is injected and dulls their movements. These are called bad statuses. Here are the types of bad statuses.

**Bound**: Tentacles or magical ropes restrict the heroine's movements. While under this bad status, she takes a -3 penalty to all rolls. This bad status can be removed by spending an Auxiliary action.

**In Heat**: The heroine's libido is over-stimulated by an aphrodisiac. While under this bad status, she takes a -1d6 penalty to all rolls. This bad status can be removed by spending an Auxiliary action. When you do so, you may claim the "Masturbation" Crisis Act if you have it.

**Enlarged Breasts**: The chest is enlarged by a special poison. While under this bad status, the Heroine's balance is thrown off. She takes a -2 penalty to Agility. IV is lowered by the same amount. This bad status can be removed by spending an Auxiliary action. When you do so, you may claim the "Breast Milk" Crisis Act if you have it.

**Need to Pee**: Please be sure to check the taste of session participants beforehand because this is a bad status that may be unpleasant for some people. Special poisons make the heroine have to urinate. While under this bad status, she can't focus. The MP costs of all spells she casts is increased by 1. This bad status can be removed by spending an Auxiliary action. When you do so, you may claim the "Peeing" Crisis Act if you have it.

**Egged**: Please be sure to check the taste of session participants beforehand because this is a bad status that may be unpleasant for some people. A monster egg has been inserted into the heroine. While under this bad status, the creature within the egg draws energy from the Heroine. She takes a -2 penalty to Body and Magic. This does not reduce HP or MP. This bad status can be removed by spending an Auxiliary action. When you do so, you may claim the "Spawning" Crisis Act if you have it.

**Futanari**: A demon's curse has caused the heroine to grow a penis. While under this bad status, unfamiliar sensations come from the member rubbing about. The heroine takes a -2 penalty to her maximum MP. This bad status can be removed by spending an Auxiliary action. When you do so, you may claim the "A Girl's Sperm" Crisis Act if you have it. This can either represent the penis wilting, or it vanishing completely.

**Exposed**: A monster's curse or a trap turns the heroine's outfit into something like an obscene swimsuit or other outfit that's barely more than being naked. While under this bad status the heroine takes a -2 penalty to Direct Hit Value. This status can only be removed by defeating the monster that gave it or having AP reach 0.

### SP Roll

The GM may demand an SP roll when a Heroine encounters an erotic situation. This roll decides if the heroine can keep her wits or is swept away by eroticism. The roll is an intelligence roll with a difficulty of the Heroine's total SP. If it fails, she acts accordingly to the erotic situation. Bad statuses and traps may apply to this roll.

In addition, the Heroine's player may relinquish the roll and simply jump into the situation. This should be based on the feelings of the Heroine.

### Using CP

Every heroine has CP, Crisis Points.

Crisis points represent the growing power in the face of great hardship and humiliation. As the heroine faces greater and greater hardship, magical energy builds up in her. This magic is released through what are Crisis Abilities.

When the session starts, CP is is at 0. As the player uses Crisis Acts and the heroine is humiliated, she gains CP. After the humiliations she can express this power by spending CP on Crisis Abilities.

### Defeat and Corruption

When a Heroine's HP drops to 0, it doesn't mean she has serious injury or is near death. Instead, it represents a complete lack of energy to fight back against the foe. At this point, she will be severely raped by demons. At this time, the Heroine must make a Corruption Roll. This roll is unique compared to others.

The Player rolls a number of d6 equal to their level plus the sum of their Ideal and Affection Emotions plus their Hatred Emotion towards the enemy who dropped them to 0 HP. If the enemy is a minion of someone they have a Hatred emotion, they can add that many d6's. If the enemy is someone they have an Affection, then the player subtracts d6s equal to that emotion instead of adding them. In addition, no ability or spell may be added to this roll. Guts, Saving Grace, Potential, or other such effects do not apply.

The target number for this roll is the Heroine's total SP.

A Heroine who succeeds at the Corruption roll is still out of the fight, but resists giving in. Her noble heart stays true. After the fight, she is restored to 1 HP. She may return to the battle through Resolution, Wish, or other such abilities.

However, if she fails the roll... the noble heart of a hero breaks and she begins to kneel as a slave to the monsters. She will no longer be a Heroine played in the game. However, whether she serves as a sex slave for the monsters or as a dark heroine is up to the player.

The presence or absence of pregnancy can also be decided by the player of the depraved Heroine. The GM may give suggestions, but it is ultimately up to the player.
