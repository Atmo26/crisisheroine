### 7. Derived Attributes

Calculate derived attributes.

**HP** Hit Points. In this game, HP represents your stamina instead of your vitality. It determines how much violation a
character can withstand [(Body * 3) + 20]

**MP** Mind Points. The strength needed to cast spells. [Evocation + (the higher of Int and Magic)]

**CP** Crisis Points. This represents the sort of power that can only be used with your back to a wall. Characters typically
begin a session with 0 and gain CP via Crisis Acts that occur upon taking damage.

**IV** Initiative. Determines the turn order in battle. [Agility + Intelligence]

**SP** Sex Points. Characters begin with 0, but as they are violated and lose their purity, this number rises to reflect their

### 9. Starting Emotions

Distribute three ranks into emotions (Ideals, Affection, Hostility), having one emotion at rank 3 is fine too. Note that
emotions also always have a specific target with differing ranks (e.g. affection 2 for a childhood friend and affection 1
for a teammate are as valid as hostility 3 for a teammate to denote a rivalry).
