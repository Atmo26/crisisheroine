### 1. Features

Choose or roll three features from the feature tables (1 from the first two, 1 each from the other two): [Feature Tables](https://atmo26.github.io/crisisheroine/Feature%20Tables)

### 2. Stats

Add 2 free stat points. Minimum 1, maximum 6. If your features put you at 7, you do not need to redistribute.

**Body**: Strength and constitution, general physical fitness.
\
**Agility**: Speed and overall flexibility.
\
**Intelligence**: Thinking ability and common sense, ability to notice in the physical sense.
\
**Magic**: Magic power, ability to notice in the magical sense.

### 3. Attributes

Distribute 10 points into Conjuration and Evocation (minimum 1).

**Conjuration**: ability to materialize magic power, basically money.
\
**Evocation**: ability to actually use magic, extra MP.

### 4. Magic

Choose 4 spells from the magic list: [Spells](https://atmo26.github.io/crisisheroine/Spells)

### 5. Crisis Ability

Choose 1 Crisis Ability from the list, also learn *Potential* for free: [Crisis Abilities](https://atmo26.github.io/crisisheroine/Crisis%20Abilities)

### 6. Equipment

Use your Conjuration to select items. Note that you do not actually lose your Conjuration but use it as a maximum capacity of equipment: [Equipment](https://atmo26.github.io/crisisheroine/Equipment)

### 7. Derived Attributes

Calculate derived attributes.

**HP**: Hit Points. In this game, HP represents your stamina instead of your vitality. It determines how much violation a
character can withstand [(Body * 3) + 20]
\
**MP**: Mind Points. The strength needed to cast spells. [Evocation + (the higher of Int and Magic)]
\
**CP**: Crisis Points. This represents the sort of power that can only be used with your back to a wall. Characters typically
begin a session with 0 and gain CP via Crisis Acts that occur upon taking damage.
\
**IV**: Initiative. Determines the turn order in battle. [Agility + Intelligence]
\
**SP**: Sex Points. Characters begin with 0, but as they are violated and lose their purity, this number rises to reflect their
increasingly lewd nature. This stat is split into Chest, Waist, Ass, Mouth, Pain and Spirit. General references to "SP"
are for Total SP. Since Corruption checks upon reaching 0 HP are made vs. your total SP, greater SP results in a
greater risk of permanently falling to darkness.

### 8. Crisis Acts

Choose 10 Crisis Acts from the list: [Crisis Acts](https://atmo26.github.io/crisisheroine/Crisis%20Acts)


### 9. Starting Emotions

Distribute three ranks into emotions (*Ideals, Affection, Hostility*), having one emotion at rank 3 is fine. Note that
emotions also always have a specific target with differing ranks (e.g. Affection 2 for a childhood friend and Affection 1
for a teammate are as valid as Hostility 3 for a teammate to denote a rivalry).
