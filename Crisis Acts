# Crisis Acts

This is the list of Crisis Acts that are used by PCs to gain CP.
You have 10 Crisis Acts. You can use up to 7 crisis acts during the session. Each Crisis Act can only be used once per
session.
Normally you can only use 1 Crisis Act per scene. However, during combat you can use multiple Crisis Acts. You must
fullfil the combat requirements for the Crisis Act to use it. (Even if you qualify for the same Crisis Act multiple times in
combat, you still can only use it once.)
PCs activate Crisis Acts to gain CP, growing stronger as they grow lewder and standing up after countless humiliations.
Each Crisis Act lists the following
CP Gain
How much CP is gained with the Crisis Act
SP Gain
How much SP is gained with the Crisis Act. It also describes where the SP is gained.
If multiple parts are listed, select which part recieves the SP.
If 2 or more SP is gained, you can split the SP into multiple parts for the Crisis Act.
Requirements
The conditions necesarry to have the CACT. If there are multiple, you must fulfil all of them.
If your character no longer fulfills the requirements, a new one needs to be chosen at end of
session.
"Disposable" can only be used once. At the end of the session, you need to choose a new
one to replace it.
Battle Condition
During battle, the Crisis Act cannot be used unless these conditions are fulfilled.
You can use multiple Crisis Acts in battle so long as you fulfil the conditions.
"AP 0" crisis acts can be used the moment the part reaches 0 AP.
"HP damage" crisis acts can be used the moment you take HP damage.
Other than that, follow the instructions for their requirements.
