In addition, when a Facility uses the phrase "in the last session" it is activated just as the session ends. Since the Corruption Roll happens during the session, the Training Room's bonus SP cannot affect the Corruption Roll. In addition, you cannot use the Arena of Shame if the Heroine falls and becomes a Dark Heroine. In addition, if a Facility requires a Dark Heroine or Heroine, you can only choose one such Facility per character.
