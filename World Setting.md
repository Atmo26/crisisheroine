## Opening

In the beginning, the world was divided into three. Earth, where we humans live, Heaven, where Gods and angels idly spend their time, and the Demon World, where demons and devils happily live a life of their own. These three worlds have been living isolated and peacefully until now.

But the balance has collapsed. What started as a small dispute between God and the Demon King quickly evolved into skirmishes between Heaven and the Demon World. That conflict has been intensifying day by day.

*"Those damn demons, let's just line them all up and kill 'em one by one!"* With that utterance from God, a large-scale invasion from Heaven to the Demon World began. As a result, the Demon World was almost destroyed. The surviving demons, searching for a new home to live in peace, began to invade the previously untouched Earth. The people of heaven tried to stop it, but their invasion of the Demon World had exhausted their manpower. They were unable to keep track of each and every demon's movements. Thus, the Demons began to encroach on the world of Humans.

The Demon population was greatly reduced by the Angel's attack. To conquer Earth, the demons must gather strength and allies alike. So the demons thought to use the women of Earth. In essence, they would absorb their life force and impregnate them. The people of heaven were outraged, but too exhausted to lend a hand.

And what are humans to do? It is impossible to fight back. Humans do not possess magic. The bodies of God, angels, and demons are kneaded from magic, and magical flesh cannot be hurt without using magic as well. And yet, their magical bodies can freely harm the normal flesh of humans. A huge disadvantage.

However, there are a humans with magical power. They are uncommon and small in number, but they exist. Why so many are women is a question for another day.

God, blind to his own shortcomings and impatience, merely sent his lowest ranked angels to Earth. These angels took the form of small, fuzzy animals called **"Enzekun"**. They taught these women how to use magic and encouraged them to fight against the Demons. After all, if Earth is conquered, then Heaven would be next. God is desperate too.

Now, in Modern Japan, a turbulent battle is about to unfold. In order to buy time for the armies of heaven to reassemble, how far will these women have to go?

## Magic

Despite possessing magical power and unique physical constitutions as a result of it, these girls didn't have a shred of knowledge on how to use magic. This was troubling to the Enzekun, but they resolved this by giving them a Catalyst.

A Catalyst is the key to using magic. A mold to shape magic into a way that can be cast. A Catalyst has two powers. One is *"Conjuration"*. It is a function to change magical power to matter and create weapons, clothes, and armor. And the other is *"Evocation"*. It is a function to generate paranormal phenomena such as shooting light bullets and flames, curing injuries, flying in the sky, and otherwise ignoring the laws of science. By giving them these two intuitively easy-to-understand functions, these girls have begun using magical power effectively. *"Transforming"* by summoning their armor and weapons instantly, and displaying feats of magic, Heroines have been born. Catalysts are small so Heroines can carry them around easily wherever they go. Taking the form of an accessory such as a ring, necklace, or hair-clip has become the norm.

However, never forget. Even if it's only for a moment, if a Heroine is separated from their Catalyst, they are powerless....

## Cartel

Two years have passed since the battle of the Heroines began.

Even with the Demons weakened state and significantly reduced numbers, the even smaller number of Heroines are not enough to stop them alone.

In fact, Demons have succeeded in attacking mankind, absorbing human essence, converting humans to their cause, impregnating human females, and little by little revving to their former glory. Among these victims are even Heroines that fell in battle.

Looking at this situation, one heroine put an idea into practice.

That is, gather and train Heroines who fight evil, investigate demonic activity, and dispatch Heroines to their location on discovery. An organization that acts as support for Heroines in battle.

Heroines commonly worked solo or in small teams, but by contrast demons commonly worked in incredibly large groups of minions. Furthermore, high-ranking demons who commanded these armies were too powerful and no match for Heroines on their own. Looking at the situation, organizational strength was the only answer.

Thus an an organization became operational in a few months. Heroines are trained as agents and various non-battle roles such as intelligence gathering, repairing damaged battle zones, and other such backup systems have also been
prepared.

Mimicking the success, several other organizations were created with a system to train and dispatch Heroine agents as well. Most of them are led by a Heroine at the top who oversees operations away from battle. Eventually, these organizations were collectively called Cartel.

Of course, not all heroines belong to a Cartel.

On the contrary, currently no existing Cartel possesses the means to identify a girl with latent magical power. They have no choice but to find an unaffiliated girl in the middle of battle, butt into the fight, and try to recruit them there.

As a result, so-called free heroines who work solo or in small teams are still large in number.

Some sample Cartels are listed below.

### Iron Maiden

The first Cartel in the world.

They advocate a a do-or-die mentality to fighting demons, aiming for their complete annihilation.

The Heroines belonging to this Cartel are trained to fundamentally show no mercy to demons or anyone who aids them. Except for in hostage or interrogation situations, they are to kill demons on sight.

Based on these policies, the Heroine of this Cartel often receive training that prioritizes fighting strength and destructive power. Even if they have to sacrifice themselves to do it, killing demons is their top priority.


### Twilight Star Church

Based on the belief that Humans - lacking in power and numbers - cannot defeat the demons, this Cartel wishes to make attempts to cooperate and reconcile with them.

They have a tendency to avoid destructive fights with demons that can understand them, preferring to try and talk it out. Ultimately, through their intimate connections with the demons, they wish to be at the top of human society in a demon-invaded Earth.

Iron Maiden sees them as "a selfish organisation that has betrayed humanity" and its members as "selling their souls to the devil."


### Sakura Sentry

A small Cartel with relatively few but elite members.

Unlike other Cartels, the fate of the world or the battle between humans and demons are not a primary concern. Instead, they focus on aiding solo-fighting Heroines and victims of demon attacks.

It is an organization overflowing with kindness, fairness, and honesty. However, they have no real long-term goal and merely haphazardly help those in need in the moment. They may perhaps accidentally act as a trigger for a calamity in the future.


## Magus

While Heroines are great warriors indeed, they have been defeated by underhanded traps and fell to evil many times in the past.

To cope with this, Iron Maiden created the *"Magus"* System.

This system aims to place Heroine agents that went to the same school or otherwise lived close by to each other in the same teams, strengthening unity and allowing each to monitor and look out for the others. If one is defeated, the others can save her, if one falls to evil, the others can pull her back to their side with the strength of their bonds.

Heroines belonging to a Magus team have code-names associated the the team's name.

For example, they could be named Prisma Cyan, Prisma Sepia, Prisma Magenta, ... belonging to Prisma Magus.

Currently, this system has not shown clear results, and still exists in an experimental trial stage.
