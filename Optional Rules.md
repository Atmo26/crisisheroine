## Corps Creation

First you create the Leader. The Leader is a Knight class or higher monster created with the monster creation rules.
\
The Corps starts with Miasma equal to ((Leader's Intelligence X 10) + 20).

## Miasma

Demonic "money" or resources. Miasma can be spent in the following ways:

### New Monster

1: Pawn
\
3: Rook
\
10: Knight
\
20: Bishop
\
However, you cannot make Bishops if the Leader is that class or below.

### Gain a Dark Heroine

For 50 Miasma, the Corps gains an NPC Level 3 Dark Heroine with 20 SP.
\
Dark Heroines will be explained later.
\
This can only be chosen in Corps Creation.

### Improve a Leader's Ability

You may increase one of the Leader's Abilities by 1. The cost to do so is double the Ability's current value in Miasma.
\
(Increasing a 3 to a 4 would be 6 miasma.) This growth can exceed the Upper Limit of the Leader's Monster Class.

### Grant the Leader a New Monster Skill

For 10 Miasma, the Leader can gain a new monster skill.

### Promote Leader

For 50 Miasma and 20 Invasion Points, the Leader can be promoted from Knight to Bishop. For 100 Miasma and 40 Invasion points, the Leader can be promoted from Bishop to King.
\
When promoting, please recalculate monster traits, ability values, monster skills and all others according to the monster creation rules. (Please handle the changes from the previous class in the promotion.)

### Acquire a Trap

You can get a disposable trap. The Miasma cost is as below.

| Trap | Miasma Cost |
| - | - |
| Poisonous Needle (Any) | 2 |
| Cinderella Maker | 2 |
| Bind Gel | 3 |
| Acid Gel | 3 |
| Immoral Pool | 4 |
| Evil Eye | 1 |
| Witch Hunt | 7 |


### Convert to Invasion Points

For 5 Miasma, you can gain 2 Invasion Points.
\
Invasion Points represent the Demon Corps influence on human society. For example, it could be financial support from co-conspirators or the popularity of the demon's turf.
\
This can only be done at Corps Creation.

### Gain Facilities

Gain a facility. You spend Invasion points instead of Miasma.

## Gaining Miasma and Invasion Points

At the end of the session, the Corps recieves Miasma equal to the total CP gained by the heroines in the session.
\
The Corps also recieves invasion points equal to the SP gained by the Heroines.
\
If a heroine is defeated in the session, the Corps only recieves half as much Miasma and Invasion Points.

## Maintenance and Operation of Corps

You can spend Miasma as in corp creation with the exception of "Gain a Dark Heroine" and "Convert to Invasion Points." In addition, monsters do not heal their DP naturally. Instead you can spend 1 maisma to heal 10 DP for a monster.
\
If a monster's DP drops to 0, the monster is effectively dead. To regain it, you need to buy it again with Miasma and remake it. (In universe, you may describe this as revival.)
\
When a dark heroine is dropped to 0 DP, she isn't killed and instead can be healed by spending Miasma as normal.

## Dark Fall of the Heroine

A Heroine who is defeated by the Demon Corps can fall and become a Dark Heroine (so long as both the player and GM are in agreeance.) The process is a bit complicated.
\
The heroine needs to fail a Corruption Roll against an enemy that she has Affection 3 or Hostility 3 towards. Or she fails against a subordanate of an enemy she has qualifying emotion towards.
\
After becoming a Dark Heroine, she loses all Crisis Acts and Crisis Abilities. Instead, the Dark Heroine has Dark Crisis Acts and a Dark Crisis Ability. She can only have three Dark Crisis Acts though. The Dark Heroine will also only ever have one Dark Crisis Ability. The Dark Heroine loses all spells and gains an equal number of Monster Skills instead. In addition, HP is changed to DP.
\
In addition, the Dark Heroines SP will not ever change.
\
In this way, the Dark Heroine will spend her days as an impotant soldier and sex slave of the Demon Corps afterwards.

## End of the Demon Corps

The Demon Corps will fall one day. It is aesthetics.
\
The Demon Corps created with these rules is no exception. It risks the posibility of its leader being defeated one day.
\
If a heroine with Affection 3 or Hostility 3 towards the Leader defeats him in battle and drops the leader below 0 DP, the leader must make a Life or Death roll. The roll uses any stat of the leader's choice with a difficulty equal to the negative amount. If the leader succeeds, he barely survives. If he fails, the leader dies and the Demon Corps is disbanded.
\
The Leader may spend 5 unused Miasma to add +1d6 to this roll and may lose a facility to add +2d6.

## Return of the Dark Heroine

If the corps of evil perish, the monsters belonging to that organization will disappear and the facilities will be lost.
\
Dark Heroines have to make a choice. There are four paths for them.

### 1. Return to be a Normal Heroine

Depending on the power of friendship and corrective action of the cartel, she can return to be a normal heroine. In terms of data, she will be back to the ability when she was a heroine.

### 2. Serve another Demon Corps

The heroine remains a dark heroine and joins a new Demon Corps. The leader of the Demon Corps pays 50 miasma for her.

### 3. She Becomes the Leader

She loses her character information and is recreated as a new Knight-class Monster. Although she takes over the human relations and setting, she is completely remade as a new character (monster).

### 4. Voluntarily Leave the Game

Does she martyr herself for her master or does she live a quiet life away from conflict. In any case, the collapse of the Demon Corps gives her the chance to be in the game as a side character.
