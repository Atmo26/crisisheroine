# Monsters

Here is the data for established monsters. Monsters are divided according to rank, from weak mobs to hard to handle scenario bosses.

Class Outlines
* Pawn: The lowest level monster. As long as they aren’t a horde, even a level one heroine can deal with them quickly.
* Rook: A low level monster. It’s a strong mob, but even a level one heroine can defeat them.
* Knight: A mid level monster. Its strength is nearly equal to a level two or three heroine.
* Bishop: A High level monster. It has enough strength to beat heroines level three or higher.

There are rules for creating monsters in another section.
